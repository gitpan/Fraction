Purpose: To Manipulate Exact Fractions

Copyright 1997 by Kevin Atkinson (kevina@cark.net)
Version .3a  (8 Mar 1997)
Alpha Release: Not Very Well Tested
Developed with Perl v 5.003_37 for Win32.
Has been testing on Perl Ver 5.003 on a solaris machine.

This program is ment to replace the old bigrat perl library.  It can do
everthing it can do and a lot more.

By using this software you have become an Alpha tester.  By becoming an
Alpha tester you have agreed to give be some sort of feedback.

This is my first real attempt at writing a Perl Module and at
Object-Oriented Programming. (Although I know this is not a true-true
Object-Oriented Module as I cheated a little). I mainly wrote it to
teach my self how to program Object-Oriently in Perl and for the challenge.

If you know of any faster or simpler way of doing any this please let me
know.

To test the module out run the fraction.pl program provided.  Type
demo to see a small demonstration of its features.

Because it is still in Alpha state their is not formal way to install it.
It use it simply unpack the tar file and run it from their.
