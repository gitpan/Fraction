Math::Fraction
Revision History:
.1a (1 March 1997) Original Release
.2a (2 March 1997) Many Internal Changes:
       Fixed reduce method so it no longer needs a list of primes after
         discovering a method in the BigInt module
       Modified + and * routines to work with as small numbers of possible
         after reading the fraction section of Knuth's "The Art of Computer
         Programming" v2 book that I checked out thanks to the reference
         in the BigInt module
       Modified - and / routines to with take the negative or receptacle 
         of the second fraction and then use the + and - method respectively
       (And when I was browsing the list I also discovered bigrat.pl, but
         not a BigRat.pm.  Oh well I guess I reinvent the real a bit but
         I think I created a better one.  I plan to eventually have it is
         the BigInt package to work with arbitrary size fractions.)
       Changed the behavior of the MIXED method slightly so that it will
         display "8/9" instead of "0 8/9"
       Fixed it so that all the internal functions calls will return list
         instead of fraction objects, simplifies things internally
       Created a separate internal reduce function that the reduce method
         calls and created a separate internal function to simplify signs.
         Also fixed it so all new fractions will automatically have their signs
         simplified (ie 1/-2 will become -1/2 and -1/-2 will become 1/2);
       And probably a few more that I forgot to mention.
.21a (3 March 97) Fixed the strange decimal conversion behavior.
.211a (3 Match 97) Fixed % by zero bug
.22 (3 March 97) Added demo a demo subroutine to the test script.
.3 (8 March 97) First Version to be Uploaded to CPAN.
   Renames to Math::Fraction
   Added Default tags
   Added Using arbitrary sized numbers.
.4 (24 March 97)
  Changed the structure of a Fraction object to now have a 'frac' part and a
    'tags' part.
  Fixed the _from_decinal sub to work properly recognize large repeating
     floats properly.
  Added support for default sets so that functions can have the own private
     set of default values.
  Added a new AUTO which when set will convert the fraction from SMALL
     to BIG as needed.
  Fixed the modify_tag so that it will convert the fraction to reflect the
     new tags.
  And a lot of other minor bugs fixed.
